# pc-shut-down-button.
This is a batch file. It will shut down your computer I have a Windows 7 and I tested it on my PC, It's completely harmless. 
You can use it to troll too :) I don't suggest that though. I will tell you how to prank others with this Simplr batch file.
you can rename this app. give it the name of a famous app like Chrome or spotify, but make sure that the victim uses that app regularly. Move the orignal app to downloads
or somewhere else, then place the batch file in it's place, I am pretty sure you see where I am going with this :) When the victim clicks the file then the file will shut down the PC.
this is not built for that though, I mean it was, but I turned it into a button.
